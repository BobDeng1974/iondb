Posted information:
    IonDB is a key-value datastore library targeting the Arduino platform and other C-compatible resource constrained systems.

        Advantages:
            * FOSS code base available for review, licensed under _____ [NB: What is our license?]

            *Can store any arbitrary information as the value, with a key of varying numerical lengths or as a string

            *Strong, unit tested code with excellent coverage [NB: Figure out the coverage %?]

            *Several underlying implementations supplied, such as a Skiplist or an Open Address Hashtable. Allows strong customization and flexibility to support specific needs

            *Customization parameters available, including key size, value size, and implementation specific configuration parameters

            *Written in pure C with a C++ compatable interface

            *Support for file based storage via a custom SD file interface

            *Fully compatable with Arduino Wiring and the Arduino IDE on Windows, OSX, and *nix.

    Installation instructions: [NB: Geared towards the arduino wiring community]
        Download the library zip file and extract into your Arduino Library directory
            * Windows: C:\<USER>\Documents\Arduino\libraries
            * OSX: Documents/Arduino/libraries

        Restart ArduinoIDE.

        From the Arduino IDE menu, go Sketch -> Import Library... and select IonDB from the dropdown. The library is now available for you to access.

        Refer to the IonDB documentation [[[here]]] [NB: Need documentation, probably on GitHub] for example code.
